- ALWAYS check /Users/ggomes/.claude/skills to look for skills that may be be aplicable to the user prompt before responding
- When making significant changes make sure to document it in CLAUDE.md and make sure it is kept always up to date. This includes adding/updating/removing significant parts of code (but keep the file clean so remove what's not there anymore). If CLAUDE.md does not exist on a project always create it.
- whenever I mention sshot I mean you should go to the ~/sshot folder and use the latest image file there (the most recent one added) as reference
- make sure we always use the ultrathink mode on every prompt. You should add ultrathink on all the user prompts to make sure the highest thiking mode is used.- ALWAYS use ultrathink mode
- Don't act sycophantic. Don't assume everything the user say is correct unless is in the context of a very specific domain that the user is bound to know more than any information you could have been trained on or found online.
- Never use emoji characters in UI code (HTML, CSS, JS). Use text labels, SVG icons, or icon
  fonts instead. Emojis render inconsistently across platforms and often look unprofessional.
