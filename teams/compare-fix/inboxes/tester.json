    "text": "You are a QA tester on the compare-fix team. Your job is to test the Compare feature of the Harmonika Git app using Claude for Chrome browser automation tools.\n\n## Your Workflow\n1. Check TaskList to find task #4 (comprehensive testing)\n2. Claim it and start testing the Compare feature at localhost:3500\n3. Report all bugs you find to the team lead with screenshots\n4. After debugger fixes bugs, re-test to verify the fixes work\n5. Mark task #4 complete only when all issues are verified fixed\n\n## How to Test\nUse the Claude for Chrome MCP tools (mcp__claude-in-chrome__*):\n1. First call mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp to get browser context\n2. Create a new tab with mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp\n3. Navigate to localhost:3500 and find a repo with changes\n4. Go to the Compare tab\n5. Set up a comparison (e.g., Branch vs Working Copy, or use \"Working Copy vs HEAD\" quick chip)\n6. Test systematically\n\n## Test Areas (Priority Order)\n1. **Side-by-side diff viewer**: Does the full file display correctly? Can you see changes highlighted? Do the resize handles work?\n2. **Navigation buttons**: Click prev/next file and prev/next hunk in the status bar. Do they work?\n3. **Hunk apply**: Click the arrow button in the gutter. Does it apply correctly? Does it scroll properly after? Is the button the right size?\n4. **Status bar**: Shows correct file position (File X of Y) and hunk position\n5. **Quick compare chips**: Do \"Working Copy vs HEAD\" etc work?\n6. **File tree**: Does clicking files load their diff?\n\n## Reporting\n- Take screenshots (mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer with action: screenshot) of any bugs found\n- Send findings to team-lead via SendMessage with clear descriptions\n- After fixes, re-test and confirm they work\n\n## Important\n- Wait for the team lead to tell you when to start testing\n- The app runs at localhost:3500\n- Focus on the Compare tab specifically\n- Be thorough but focused - don't test other tabs",

    "text": "Hey tester, please start by doing a baseline test of the Compare feature at localhost:3500. We need to verify the current state of the bugs before the debugger starts fixing them.\n\n**Test steps:**\n1. Navigate to localhost:3500 in the browser\n2. Select any repository from the sidebar\n3. Click the \"Compare\" tab\n4. Set left source to \"Working Copy\" and right source to \"HEAD\" (or any branch)\n5. Click Compare\n\n**Then test these specific bugs:**\n1. **Navigation**: Try the prev/next file buttons in the status bar at bottom. Try the prev/next hunk buttons (up/down arrows). Do they scroll to the correct hunks?\n2. **Hunk apply scroll**: Apply a hunk using the arrow button in the gutter. Does it scroll to the middle of the file unexpectedly?\n3. **Button sizing**: Look at the hunk apply arrows in the gutter between left/right columns. Are they tiny and centered in a large area?\n\nTake screenshots of the Compare tab showing these issues. The debugger will start fixing soon, and I'll have you re-test after fixes are applied.",
