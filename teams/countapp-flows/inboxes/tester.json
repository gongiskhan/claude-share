First install all dependencies: cd to project root and run `npm install`\n2. Start MongoDB if not running: `docker-compose up -d`\n3. Try to start the countapp-mcp server directly to verify it registers all tools:\n   `cd /Users/ggomes/dev/probable-palm-tree && node packages/countapp-mcp/src/index.js`\n   (This should output tool registration info to stderr. It will hang waiting for stdio input - that's expected. Just verify from stderr output that it starts and registers tools. Kill it after a few seconds.)\n\n4. Verify the following files exist and are valid:\n   - ~/.palmtree/flows/accounting-assistant.yaml (has mcp_servers: [countapp] and steps)\n   - ~/.palmtree/flows/sequence.yaml (has flows: [accounting-assistant])\n   - ~/.palmtree/instructions/general-instructions.md (in Portuguese)\n   - ~/.palmtree/instructions/accounting-assistant.md (in Portuguese, references all tools)\n   - ~/.palmtree/config.yaml (welcome_message in Portuguese, locale pt-PT)\n   - ~/.palmtree/mcp.yaml (countapp server configured)\n\n5. Check that countapp-mcp source files import correctly:\n   - packages/countapp-mcp/src/index.js imports all tool modules\n   - packages/countapp-mcp/src/tools/statements.js exists\n   - packages/countapp-mcp/src/tools/tickets.js exists  \n   - packages/countapp-mcp/src/tools/documents.js exists\n\n6. Check each tool file has proper descriptions with Portuguese terms in parentheses.\n\n7. Try starting all services: `npm run dev` (run for 15-20 seconds, check for startup errors, then stop)\n\n8. If CountApp API is running at localhost:8081, test:\n   a) GET http://localhost:8081/accounting-api/api/users/base/test-id (expect 401 without auth)\n   b) Verify the API is reachable\n\nReport all findings - what works, what fails, what needs fixing.",
