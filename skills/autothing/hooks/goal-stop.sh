# autothing goal-loop Stop hook  (reproduces /goal, deterministically) — PER SESSION
#
# type:"command" Stop hook. NO model call, NO `claude -p`, NO Agent SDK.
# Blocks the stop (forcing another turn) while THIS session has an armed autothing
# run that has NOT yet printed its terminal `GLOBAL GATE:` verdict.
#
# Per-session sentinel: ~/.autothing/sentinels/<session_id>.json. Each concurrent
# session has its OWN sentinel, so parallel autothing runs never clobber each other.
# Phase 0 writes it keyed by $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID; this hook reads it keyed by the
# Stop event's session_id (the same id) — no cross-session interference is possible.
#
# Termination (any -> allow the stop, exit 0):
#   * no session id / no sentinel for this session  -> not our run
#   * transcript has the terminal GLOBAL GATE line   -> done (delete sentinel)
#   * iteration >= turnCap                            -> turn-budget backstop (surface)
# Otherwise -> increment + emit {"decision":"block", ...} to take another turn.
#
# FAIL SAFE: any error/ambiguity -> exit 0 (ALLOW the stop). A wrong block is a
# runaway; allowing the stop is the safe failure. CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP
# (raised in settings.json) is the platform backstop behind this hook.
